## Red Hawk Knight

### Traits

**Heavy Armour Proficient** – Red Hawk Knights are highly trained in wearing heavy armour and do not suffer the -1 Move penalty for wearing it.

**Save the Children** – Red Hawk Knights gain a special bonus of +15 experience points for any scenario in which a child is saved or rescued.

## Chthonian Mage

### Traits

**Dark Vision** – Chthonian Mages can see in the dark just as well as they can in the light. They never suffer any penalties of any kind (usually line of sight or shooting) because of low-light or darkness.

**Plant Warden** – Chthonian Mages receive +3 Fight and +3 Armour when fighting plants, such as darkroot vines.

### Limitations

**No Spellbooks or Wands** – Because Chthonian Mages use an animistic form of spellcasting, they may not use either spellbooks or wands.

**Spell Limitations** – While Chthonian Mages have access to all the spells in the main rulebook, some of the more offensive spells they can only take once (as opposed to rangers who may take a given spell any number of times).

**Weapon and Armour Limitations** – Chthonian Mages cannot wear heavy armour as it interferes with their spellcasting. While not forbidden, Chthonian Mages never train to use bows, crossbows, or two-handed weapons and receive -2 Fight/Shoot when using them. Hand weapons, staffs, daggers and throwing knives suffer no penalty.

## River Shark

### Traits

**Boatmen** – River Sharks gain +3 to all rolls for the purpose of handling a boat.

**Swimming Master** – If a River Shark fails a Swimming Roll, it suffers only half the normal damage, rounded down, and may still make one move of up to 3" before its activation ends, provided it is not in combat. This trait does not apply if the figure is wearing armour of any type.

**Throwing Knife Master** – River Sharks can carry two throwing knives with one item slot. When using a throwing knife, they do not suffer the usual -1 damage penalty.

**Treasure Keeper** – If players find 'Gold and Jewels' during a game, and one of them is running a River Shark, the 'gold and jewels' can be traded in for +15 experience or 2 Progression Points split between two companions. Any treasures that state they must be given back at the end of a mission must still be returned by River Sharks.

**Two-Weapon Fighter** – If a River Shark is equipped with two hand weapons, or a hand weapon and a dagger, and is not carrying a shield, then it does +2 damage in melee combat, and any figure it is in combat with only gains +1 for each supporting figure (instead of the normal +2).

**Holy Icon** – Servants of Seth always carry a Holy Icon, which does not take up one of their item slots, though it does count as the one piece of magical equipment that they can take as standard (all other magical equipment must be obtained during adventures).

**Innate Heroic Action** – Servants of Seth focus on defeating the undead. Thus, they can always trade any Heroic Action they currently have for Halt Undead. They can make this trade at any time and may even use it more than once during a scenario.

**Innate Spells** – Servants of Seth are all trained in the casting of a few specific spells. A servant can always convert any of its spells to one of the following spells at any point: Burning Light, Shield of Light, and Magic Bolt (though this can only be cast against an undead creature).

**Taref** – Servants of Seth have access to a special throwing weapon called a taref. A servant may carry as many of these as it has item slots available. It may carry one taref in place of the 'free' item slot usually reserved for a dagger or throwing knife.

### Limitations

**No Wands** – Servants of Seth never use wands in spellcasting.

**Spell Limitations** – There are a few spells that Servants of Seth cannot cast. These are detailed below.

**Weapon Limitations** – Servants of Seth cannot use bladed or piercing weapons. Functionally, this means that they cannot use bows, crossbows, or throwing knives.

Servants also cannot use any specific magic weapons that state they are bladed or piercing such as swords, axes, picks, spears, etc.

## Varakian Archer

### Traits

**Craft Bow** – After any scenario, if a Varakian Archer does not have a bow and has no way of obtaining one, it may craft a temporary bow out of whatever material is available. This bow does -1 damage, but otherwise functions the same as a normal bow.

**Enchant Arrow** – A Varakian Archer may spend an action to enchant an arrow. This can take the place of its normally required move action. The next time the archer fires its bow, the shot counts as Magic and does +1 damage.

**Enhanced Quiver** – A Varakian Archer that is carrying a Quiver may carry up to 3 magical arrows in the quiver without them taking up an item slot (instead of the usual 1).

### Limitations

**No Heavy Armour or Shields** – Varakian Archers may not wear heavy armour or carry shields as they interfere with their aim.

**No Spells** – Varakian Archers cannot learn or cast spells, other than their magical tricks with arrows, and never count as a spellcaster.

## Vampire Hunter

### Traits

**Blood Price** – Whenever a vampire hunter activates, it may choose to suffer 1 point of damage. If it does, all its attacks against undead count as magic attacks and do +1 damage until its next activation.

**Chosen Foe** – If the vampire hunter participates in a scenario in which a vampire is killed, then all heroes gain +5 experience points in addition to any other rewards. If the vampire hunter directly kills a vampire, increase this to +10 experience points.

**Hand Crossbow** – Vampire hunters have access to the unique hand crossbow weapon.

**Steel Mind** – Vampire hunters receive +3 to any Will Rolls to resist any kind of hypnosis or mind control.

## Scrollmaster of Melnoth

### Traits

**Magic Resistance** – Scrollmasters are practised in resisting magic spells. They gain +3 to all Will Rolls to resist spells. If they are the target of an attack generated by a spell, they gain +3 Fight on any Combat Rolls to not be hit, and +3 Armour if they are hit.

**Scrollmaster** – Scrollmasters may carry up to three scrolls in one item slot. Additionally, they may copy a spell from a scroll into their spellbook if no other spell is currently saved in the spellbook. In this case the scroll is destroyed.

**Seekers of Knowledge** – Scrollmasters gain +1 experience point in any scenario in which any kind of book or scroll is found by the group (the work does not have to be magical).

**Spellbook Caster** – Scrollmasters are trained in casting magic spells directly from spellbooks. This figure may purchase one 'open' spell slot for the cost of 1 Build Point. So long as this figure is carrying a spellbook, it may use this open spell slot to cast any spell found in the main rulebook. Additionally, this figure may carry a spellbook without it taking up an item slot.

Scrollmasters may still use their spellbook in the normal way, but it can only be used to save another spell known by the spellcaster. It cannot save an open spell slot, nor any spell that the figure can only cast through the open spell slot. For example, a spellcaster that knows Magic Bolt and Heal, and has an open spell slot, may only save Magic Bolt and Heal in the spellbook.

If the figure somehow loses its spellbook, it may not use its open slot to cast a spell until it obtains another spellbook.

### Limitations

**Armour Limitation** – Scrollmasters may not wear heavy or light armour or carry shields as they interfere with their spellcasting.

**Weapon Limitations** – Scrollmasters are not trained fighters. They may never use two-handed weapons, bows, or crossbows.

## Encarnoth Delver

### Traits

**Determine Weakness** – Due to their vast knowledge of ancient myths and legends, delvers often know the weaknesses of various creatures. If this figure is within line of sight of a creature, it may spend an action (which can replace a move action) and make an Ancient Lore Roll with a Target Number equal to 10 plus the creature's Will Stat (so TN15 if the creature has Will +5). If successful, all heroes fighting against this type of creature gain +1 Fight for the rest of the scenario. This must be exactly the same type of creature (two gnoll archers qualify, but a gnoll archer and a gnoll fighter do not). If this figure uses this trait on a second type of creature in the same scenario, the bonus on the first type of creature is lost.

**Endure Hardship** – Encarnoth Delvers are used to a life of hardship and going for extended periods on reduced food and water. If this figure is suffering from Hunger and Thirst, it only suffers a -1 penalty to its starting Health each scenario instead of the normal -2. It also gains +5 to all rolls against Disease.

**Pack Rat** – Encarnoth Delvers have one extra item slot, as they are masters of packing carefully to maximize space and save weight.

**Skillmaster (Choice)** – This figure gains +3 to any one skill, selected by the player.

### Limitations

**Limited Weapons and Armour** – Delvers cannot wear heavy armour, carry shields, or use two-handed weapons.

## Wasteland Firesword

### Traits

**Endure Hardship** – Wastelanders are used to a life of hardship and going for extended periods on reduced food and water. If this figure is suffering from Hunger and Thirst, it only suffers a -1 penalty to its starting Health each scenario instead of the normal -2. It also gains +5 to all rolls against Disease.

**Exotic Weapons** – Fireswords can take 'fire wax' and 'fire flasks' as part of the Basic Equipment List.

**Two-Weapon Fighter** – If the firesword is equipped with two hand weapons, or a hand weapon and a dagger, then it does +2 damage in melee combat, and any figure it is in combat with only gains +1 for each supporting figure (instead of the normal +2).

### Limitations

**Cannot Be Spellcasters** – Fireswords may never be spellcasters and thus never take spells or use scrolls or spellbooks.

**Cannot Swim** – There is no deep water in the Waste, so no wastelander knows how to swim. This figure suffers -3 to all Swimming Rolls. Additionally, its Swim Skill may never be increased until this limitation is removed.

**Limited Weapons and Armour** – Wastelanders never wear heavy armour or carry shields as they are extremely impractical in the heat of the Waste. Wastelanders also never use crossbows as these weapons are not part of their culture.
